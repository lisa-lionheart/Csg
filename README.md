# CSG For Unity

Constructive Solid Geometry is a modeling library that provides
3D solid primitives and operators to manipulate them.

This is a for of a manual port of [OpenJsCad's](https://github.com/joostn/OpenJsCad) [csg.js](https://github.com/joostn/OpenJsCad/blob/gh-pages/src/csg.js) replacing vector and matrices with Unity versions.


## Development

To build Csg, you need C# 8.0 available through [.NET Core 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
